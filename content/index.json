Since then my 3 year old daughter and I have been on bear hunts around the city, bubble popping in Central Park, bug collecting on the Brooklyn Promenade and catching pet rocks in Prospect Park and much more besides. I have loved exploring New York with my daughter but I also love web development and am keen to start building things again and talking with other adults. "
